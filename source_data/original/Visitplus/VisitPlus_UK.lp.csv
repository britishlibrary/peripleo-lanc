It has long been one of the most loved places in Scotland.
What is Glencoe famous for? It’s known equally for its awe-inspiring views and sorrowful past – it is a place of history, wildlife, adventure and myth. The mountains were formed through violent volcanic eruptions, and then sculpted by massive glaciers. Fingal, the legendary Celtic hero, is said to have made his home among these towering mountains, while his poet son, Ossian, found inspiration in the landscape.
On 13 February 1692, 38 men, women and children of the MacDonald clan were murdered by a regiment of soldiers (acting on behalf of the government) whom they had welcomed into their homes. The tragedy of the Glencoe Massacre still has the power to evoke powerful emotions.
The Trust has cared for Glencoe since 1935. We work to maintain footpaths, look after the fragile biodiversity and keep the landscape as precious and wild as it was when it first came into our care.
300 years ago, hundreds of Highlanders lived in townships, up and down the glen. Get a flavour for Clan MacDonald’s way of life in our new reconstruction of a turf and creel house.

Eight months before the Battle of Culloden, 1,200 Highlanders gathered in Glenfinnan to pledge their allegiance to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. After raising the royal standard (flag) and sharing a brandy, they set off on a fateful campaign to regain the British throne for a Stuart king. 

In 1815, the 18m-high monument was built as a poignant reminder of the clansmen who gave their lives to the Jacobite cause. Today you can climb to the top and stand beside the lone Highlander for a unique Highland panorama. 

Our visitor centre, with its café and gift shop, is the perfect gateway to explore all Glenfinnan’s attractions.

1705,The Tenement House,https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-tenement-house,National Trust for Scotland,"An authentic time capsule of life in early 20th-century Glasgow At first glance, the Tenement House appears to be an ordinary middle-class tenement from the late 19th century, standing in Garnethill. However, when you step inside, the faithfully restored four rooms appear as if frozen in time and provide a rare glimpse into life in Glasgow in the early 20th century. 
 Shorthand typist Miss Agnes Toward lived here from 1911 until 1965, and preserved her furniture and possessions with love and care. She held on to all sorts of things that most people would have thrown away, and this extensive personal archive has become a valuable time capsule for visitors today. The Tenement House also reveals what it meant to be an ‘independent woman’ at that time. ",Homes & Work,,,55.868097,-4.268369,,
1706,Thomas Carlyle’s Birthplace,https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/thomas-carlyles-birthplace,National Trust for Scotland,"Childhood home of one of Britain’s most influential thinkers Little did anyone know that the boy born here in 1795 would go on to become one of the most prolific writers and social commentators of the 19th century. 
 The unassuming exterior of this wee house in Ecclefechan, near Lockerbie, belies its significance in Scottish history. The house was constructed by Thomas Carlyle’s father and uncle – both local stonemasons – and is a fine example of Scottish 18th-century vernacular architecture. 
 When Thomas Carlyle was 13, he left Ecclefechan and walked 84 miles to Edinburgh, to attend the university. 
 The Arched House has remained virtually untouched since 1881, when it first opened to the public. ",Famous Scots/Homes & Work,,,55.059237,-3.264157,,

Considered by many to embody the North Highland landscape of Scotland, Torridon is an ancient and enchanting wilderness of water and rock. The rugged mountains are incredibly old – the Torridonian sandstone that forms the bulk of all the mountains dates back 750 million years. On the west side of the estate the hilly and loch-strewn landscape is even older. Composed of Lewisian Gneiss, it’s over 2,600 million years old and it was the erosion of this land that provided the sediment, laid down in shallow seas, for the sandstone we know today.
Part of the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve is on the Torridon estate and, along with other designations, the estate supports an impressive variety of flora and fauna, including important plant colonies, rare mosses and lichens, and the elusive pine marten and golden eagle.
There’s an amazing choice of walking and climbing routes on the property, with over 18 miles of paths to choose from. Five of the Trust’s Munros are found here, including Liathach, peaking at 1,054m (3,456ft), and Beinn Alligin at 985m (3,230ft).",Outdoors,,,57.5441624,-5.5043601,,
